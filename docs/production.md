## Enabling TLS

The "UI port", default 8080, serves unencrypted HTTP communications.
When exposing this service to the internet, you'll need to secure it
with TLS. The recommended way for doing this is with a reverse proxy
handling the TLS termination.

### Caddy reverse proxy

The [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com) project provides an easy-to-use
reverse proxy with built-in [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
support.

A simple Caddyfile can function as a TLS terminated reverse proxy with:
```
# ./caddy/Caddyfile
dg.example.com {
    reverse_proxy satellite-server:8080
}
```

A Docker Compose deployment could be done with:
```
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  webserver:
    image: caddy:alpine
    volumes:
      - ./caddy/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
      - ./caddy/data:/data
      - ./caddy/config:/config
    ports:
      - 80:80
      - 443:443
    depends_on:
      - dg
  dg:
    image: <your satellite server container>
    command:
      - --datadir=/data
      - serve
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
```

## Backups

The server stores all of its data under the `--datadir`. This can be
backed up as needed.

## HA failover

The satellite server has a single SQLite database file, `<datadir>/db.sqlite`.
You can use the [Litestream](https://litestream.io/) project to stream
updates to an S3 compatible bucket or NFS share.

One way to handle failover would be:

 * Create an NFS mount on your primary server, `/data-nfs`.
 * Move all subdirectories of `/data` to `/data-nfs`:
   * `audit`
   * `auth`
   * `certs`
   * `devices`
   * `updates`
   * `users`
 * Create symlinks from those directories on `/data-nfs` to `/data`.
 * Use litestream to replicate `/data/db.sqlite` to `/data-nfs`

When the failover VM comes up, it:
 * mounts `/data-nfs`
 * copies `/data-nfs/db.sqlite` to `/data`.
 * ensures `/data` has symlinks to all the subdirectories of `/data-nfs`.


***NOTE:*** It is not recommended to put a SQLite database directly
on an NFS share.
